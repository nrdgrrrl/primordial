# AGENT.md — Primordial Codebase Context

This document is for AI coding agents tasked with extending or modifying the Primordial codebase.

## Project Summary

Primordial is a fullscreen Python screensaver featuring a cellular evolution simulation with bioluminescent visuals. Creatures with heritable genomes compete for food, reproduce with mutations, and evolve over time. The app is designed to run indefinitely on a monitor.

**Design philosophy:**
- Simulation and rendering are strictly decoupled
- All behavior is driven by the `Config` object — no hardcoded magic numbers
- Performance-sensitive code uses spatial bucketing (no O(n²) loops)
- Creatures are data-driven: the genome determines all behavior
- Visual themes are pluggable and don't affect simulation logic

## Key Abstractions

### Genome (`simulation/genome.py`)

Immutable dataclass holding creature traits (all `float` 0.0–1.0):

**Original traits:**
- `speed`, `size`, `sense_radius`, `aggression`, `hue`, `saturation`, `efficiency`

**Boids trait (added in modes pass):**
- `conformity` — 0–1; controls alignment force strength in boids mode; inert (random drifts) in other modes

**Glyph traits (added in enhancement pass):**
- `complexity` — 0–1 → maps to 2–7 strokes in the glyph
- `symmetry` — 0=asymmetric, 0.33=bilateral, 0.66=3-fold radial, 1.0=4-fold radial
- `stroke_scale` — overall proportion/delicacy of strokes
- `appendages` — 0–1 → 0–4 extra limb strokes at perimeter
- `rotation_speed` — glyph rotation speed (0=still, 1=steady spin)

**Motion trait:**
- `motion_style` — 0.00–0.33=glide, 0.34–0.66=swim, 0.67–1.00=dart

**Key methods:**
- `Genome.random()` — create random genome
- `genome.mutate(rate)` — return new genome with mutated traits
- `genome.copy()` — exact copy

**Invariant:** All trait values stay in [0.0, 1.0] after mutation.

### Creature (`simulation/creature.py`)

Mutable dataclass representing a single organism:

**Core fields:** `x`, `y`, `vx`, `vy`, `energy`, `age`, `genome`, `trail`

**Added fields:**
- `lineage_id: int` — inheritable lineage identifier for kin tracking; new ID on speciation (hue mutation > 0.15)
- `rotation_angle: float` — current glyph rotation in degrees, updated each frame
- `glyph_surface: Any` — cached glyph pygame.Surface set by renderer; `None` until first render; reset to `None` to force rebuild
- `_swim_phase: float` — internal oscillation state for swim motion
- `_dart_burst_remaining: int`, `_dart_cooldown: int` — dart burst state machine

**Aging methods (selection-pressure pass):**
- `get_max_lifespan()` — 3000 + longevity × 7000 frames
- `get_age_fraction()` — current age / max_lifespan
- `get_age_speed_mult()` — 1.0 until 70% lifespan, then linear to 0.5
- `get_effective_sense_radius()` — accounts for aging after 85% lifespan

**Trail length** varies by motion style: glide=14, swim=10, dart=5 (`get_trail_length()`).

**Motion styles** (in `wander()` and `update_position()`):
- **Glide**: very gentle direction changes, slow speed
- **Swim**: moderate wandering + sinusoidal lateral oscillation applied in `update_position`
- **Dart**: mostly stationary (`vx *= 0.95`) with random bursts at ~1.8× max speed every 3–5 seconds

**Mode-specific fields:**
- `species: str` — "none" (all non-predator_prey modes), "prey", or "predator"
- `flock_id: int` — -1 (loner / not in boids mode), ≥0 = boids flock component id
- `_glyph_phase: float` — pulse animation phase; initialised to `genome.hue * 6.28`
  at spawn; updated on every cosmic-ray mutation and reproduction; in boids mode
  slowly phase-locks toward flock average via `_update_boids_glyph_phases()`

**Key methods (unchanged):**
- `update_position(dt, world_width, world_height)` — move, wrap, update trail and rotation
- `steer_toward(x, y, speed_base, world_width, world_height)` — smooth steering (dart uses stronger steer)
- `wander(speed_base)` — motion-style-aware wandering
- `distance_to(x, y, world_width, world_height)` — toroidal distance
- `get_radius()`, `get_sense_radius()`, `get_movement_cost()`

**Invariant:** Creatures always wrap around world edges.

### FoodManager (`simulation/food.py`)

Spatial bucketing for efficient nearest-neighbor queries.

**Notable method:** `resize_world(width, height)` rewraps particles and rebuilds
buckets after display/simulation size changes.

### Simulation (`simulation/simulation.py`)

Main simulation controller. Owns `creatures`, `food_manager`, `settings`.

**Added fields:**
- `_next_lineage_id: int` — monotone counter for lineage ID allocation
- `death_events: list[dict]` — populated each frame when creatures die; cleared by renderer
- `birth_events: list[Creature]` — populated each frame on reproduction; cleared by renderer
- `cosmic_ray_events: list[tuple[float,float]]` — (x, y) positions for cosmic ray animations; cleared by renderer
- `active_attacks: list[tuple]` — (ax, ay, tx, ty, hue) attack lines; rebuilt per frame; consumed by renderer
- `zone_manager: ZoneManager` — fixed environmental zones; reset() regenerates them
- `_old_age_lifespans: deque[float]` — rolling last-20 natural deaths in frames

**Death event dict keys:** `x`, `y`, `genome`, `glyph_surface`, `lineage_id`, `cause` ("energy" | "age")

**Key methods (updated):**
- `step()` — populates all event queues; runs food cycle, hunting, cosmic rays, aging
- `get_lineage_counts() -> dict[int, int]`
- `get_dominant_traits()` — now includes all 14 genome traits (+ longevity)
- `get_hunter_grazer_counts() -> tuple[int, int, int]` — (hunters, grazers, opportunists)
- `food_cycle_phase` property — 0.0=famine, 1.0=feast
- `avg_old_age_lifespan_seconds` property — rolling avg of last 20 natural deaths

**Invariants (all preserved):**
- `step()` never calls pygame or modifies rendering state
- Genome is still immutable; mutation returns new instance

### Renderer (`rendering/renderer.py`)

Reads simulation state and draws to pygame surface. Now orchestrates three additional visual systems.

**Key methods:**
- `draw(simulation)` — render current state (calls all sub-systems)
- `set_theme(name)`, `toggle_hud()`

**Sub-systems called in `draw()`:**
1. `process_events()` on AnimationManager (ingest death/birth events, clear queues)
2. `_draw_territory_shimmer()` — top-N lineage shimmer ellipses
3. `_draw_kin_lines()` — faint intra-lineage connection lines
4. `theme.render_creature(creature, scale=birth_scale)` — glyph + glow
5. `animation_manager.tick_and_draw()` — death effects, birth scales

**Territory shimmer state:** `_shimmer_states: dict[int, ShimmerState]` — persists across frames; centroids lerp, alpha pulses on sine wave.

**Invariant:** Renderer never mutates simulation state (death/birth event lists are cleared here after processing, which is permitted since renderer owns the consumption contract).

### Theme (`rendering/themes.py`)

Abstract base class. `render_creature` now accepts `scale: float = 1.0` parameter (backward-compatible).

**OceanTheme rendering order per creature:**
1. Trail segments (fading circles)
2. Bloom glow halo (`_create_glow_surface`)
3. Rotated glyph surface (`get_glyph_surface`)

### Glyph System (`rendering/glyphs.py`)

Procedural symbolic glyph generation from genome.

**Stroke vocabulary:**
- `_draw_arc(surface, cx, cy, size, color, alpha, angle_start, angle_sweep, radius_ratio)` — partial circle arc
- `_draw_line(...)` — straight line radiating from center
- `_draw_loop(...)` — small closed oval attached at offset point
- `_draw_fork(...)` — Y-shaped split
- `_draw_spiral(...)` — inward spiral
- `_draw_dot(...)` — small filled circle offset from center

**Key functions:**
- `build_glyph_surface(genome, color, base_size) -> pygame.Surface` — fully deterministic from genome hash seed; applies symmetry and appendages
- `get_glyph_surface(creature, color, base_size) -> pygame.Surface` — returns cached or builds fresh; caches on `creature.glyph_surface`

**Determinism guarantee:** `_genome_hash_seed()` quantizes traits to 3dp and hashes the tuple; same genome always produces same glyph.

### AnimationManager (`rendering/animations.py`)

Manages all active visual animations. Completely decoupled from simulation/.

**Animation types:**
- `DeathAnimation` — 40-frame dissolution: white flash at frame 0, glyph fades+shrinks to 0.3×, 4–6 scatter particles over 20 frames
- `BirthScaleTracker` — 30-frame ease-out-cubic scale-up from 0.2× to 1.0×; tracked per `id(creature)`
- `ParentPulse` — 15-frame expanding ring on reproducing parent (not yet wired to simulation, can be added)

**Key methods:**
- `process_events(death_events, birth_events, get_color)` — create animations from event queues
- `get_birth_scale(creature) -> float | None` — query current scale override for a creature
- `tick_and_draw(surface)` — advance + draw all active animations

### ZoneManager (`simulation/zones.py`)

Generates and manages fixed environmental zones at startup.

**Zone types** (defined in `ZONE_DEFINITIONS` dict):

| Zone | Favours | Penalises | BG colour |
|------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| `warm_vent` | efficiency↑, size↑ | speed↑ | deep amber |
| `open_water` | speed↑, size↓ | aggression↑ | pale blue |
| `kelp_forest` | sense_radius↑, aggression↓ | speed↑ | deep green |
| `hunting_ground` | aggression↑, speed↑ | longevity↑ | deep red |
| `deep_trench` | longevity↑, size↓ | efficiency↑ | deep indigo |

**Zone effect application** (per creature per frame):
1. For each zone, compute distance weight (0 at edge, 1 at centre).
2. Compute `_trait_effect(zone_type, genome)`: favoured traits → negative value (cheaper energy), penalised → positive (costlier).
3. Sum contributions × weight × strength → clamp to [0.75, 1.25].
4. Multiply creature's total `energy_cost` by this modifier.

**Performance:** O(zone_count) per creature per frame — trivial even at 250 creatures.

**HUD helper:** `get_dominant_zone(creatures)` returns label of the zone containing the most creatures (by highest overlap weight).

### Aggression Behaviour Tiers

Three tiers defined by `genome.aggression`:

| Tier | Range | Behaviour | Cost | Advantage |
|------|-------|-----------|------|-----------|
| Hunter | > 0.6 | Seeks nearest creature ≤1.3× own radius within `sense×1.5`; attacks within `radius×4` | `aggression×0.0012/frame` drain; 0.85× food sense | Attack gain `aggression×0.008×size_ratio/frame` |
| Opportunist | 0.4–0.6 | Eats food; attacks creatures <60% own size nearby | Moderate | None |
| Grazer | < 0.4 | Pure food-seeking | None | +20% food efficiency bonus |

Hunting uses a **creature spatial bucket** (150px cells, built per frame) to avoid O(n²) scanning. Only cells within `sense_radius` distance are checked.

Attack lines rendered by `renderer._draw_attack_lines()` — thin 1px hue-colored lines, alpha 40.

### Lifespan / Aging System

**`genome.longevity`** (new trait, 0–1): controls max lifespan.

`max_lifespan = 3000 + longevity × 7000` frames (50s–167s at 60fps).

Aging effects (computed by creature methods, applied in `update_position` and `simulation.step`):

| Life fraction | Speed effect | Sense effect |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| 0–70% | ×1.0 | ×1.0 |
| 70–100% | ×1.0 → ×0.5 linearly | ×1.0 |
| 85–100% | ×1.0 | ×1.0 → ×0.6 linearly |

**r/K tradeoff:** High longevity = long-lived but pays `longevity×0.0004/frame` maintenance. Low longevity = cheap but dies young.

Visual: grey wash overlay applied at blit time (not glyph cache) reaches alpha 160 at max lifespan.

**HUD:** "Oldest" stat shows `N% lifespan` rather than raw frames.

### Food Cycle

Sinusoidal spawn rate: `food_spawn_rate × (0.5 + 0.5 × sin(2π × t / food_cycle_period))`.  Phase 0 = famine (near-zero spawn); phase 1 = feast (2× base rate).  `food_cycle_phase` property exposed for HUD bar.

### Cosmic Rays

Each frame each living creature has `cosmic_ray_rate` chance of a single-trait mutation via `genome.mutate_one(std=0.15)`.  If the hit trait is `hue` and shift > 0.2, a new `lineage_id` is allocated (visible speciation).  Position emitted to `simulation.cosmic_ray_events` → `CosmicRayAnimation` (20-frame expanding white ring, alpha 50).

### Selection Pressure — How the Systems Interact

All four systems create converging selection pressure:

1. **Food cycle** drives boom/bust population oscillation.  During famine, only the most energy-efficient creatures survive.  This selects for high `efficiency` (grazers) and high `longevity` (creatures that can outlast famine on stored energy).

2. **Aggression / predation** creates a frequency-dependent layer on top of the food cycle.  Hunters thrive when prey density is high (feast); struggle during famine when prey is also starving.  This prevents hunters from completely eliminating grazers: when grazers become rare, hunting becomes unprofitable and hunter numbers drop, allowing grazers to recover.

3. **Zones** add spatial texture.  Creatures in `hunting_ground` evolve higher aggression and speed; creatures in `kelp_forest` or `deep_trench` evolve toward low aggression, high sense_radius, or high longevity.  This produces regionally distinct phenotypes visible in glyph appearance.

4. **Cosmic rays** act as a continuous mutation floor, preventing fixation.  At 0.0003/frame with 100 creatures, there's ~1 cosmic ray per 33 frames (~0.5s).  This continuously re-introduces rare phenotypes, preventing permanent extinction of any strategy.

**Expected equilibrium:** Hunter-heavy population (H:G ratio ~4:1) with:
- Average aggression drifting toward 0.6–0.8
- Average efficiency co-rising (hunters who also forage well survive famine)
- Grazers persisting as minority, cycling in abundance with feast periods
- Zone-adapted local clusters visible in glyph shape families by generation 300

**Selection speed levers:**
- Increase `mutation_rate` (faster drift, less genetic diversity)
- Increase `cosmic_ray_rate` (more random jumps, maintains diversity)
- Increase `food_cycle_period` (longer feast/famine — more dramatic selection)
- Increase `zone_strength` (stronger regional pressure)
- Decrease `food_max_particles` (sharper famines — stronger selection per cycle)
- Increase `aggression * drain` coefficient — makes hunters riskier, slows aggression takeover

### Configuration (`config/config.py`)

`Config` now loads committed canonical defaults from `primordial/config/defaults.toml`
and layers the platform user `config.toml` on top. Python owns validation,
coercion, clamping, typed access, and derived values only.

Canonical user-meaningful defaults currently include:

```
# Original glyph/animation fields:
glyph_size_base: int = 48
kin_line_max_distance: float = 120.0
kin_line_min_group: int = 3
territory_top_n: int = 3
territory_shimmer_lerp: float = 0.05
territory_fade_seconds: float = 2.0
death_animation_frames: int = 40
birth_animation_frames: int = 30
death_particle_count: int = 5

# Selection-pressure pass fields:
food_max_particles: int = 300       # food cap; lower = sharper famines
food_cycle_period: int = 1800       # frames per boom/bust cycle (~30s)
food_cycle_enabled: bool = True
cosmic_ray_rate: float = 0.0003     # prob/creature/frame for spontaneous mutation
zone_count: int = 5                  # number of environmental zones at startup
zone_strength: float = 0.8          # global zone effect multiplier (0 = disabled)
```

## Sim Mode Contract

All four modes are implemented as `_step_<mode>()` private methods on the single
`Simulation` class. `step()` dispatches to the appropriate method based on
`settings.sim_mode`. A new mode must:

1. Add `_step_<mode>(self) -> None` to Simulation
2. Add `_spawn_initial_population_<mode>(self) -> None` and register it in
   `_spawn_initial_population()`
3. Add mode name to `Settings.VALID_SIM_MODES`
4. Add canonical defaults in `primordial/config/defaults.toml`
5. Update `Config` parsing/serialization for the new mode

**What a mode may override:**
- Food spawning (call or skip `_spawn_food()`)
- Energy model (regen, costs, thresholds)
- Movement behaviour (may call `wander()`, `steer_toward()`, or custom helpers)
- Death conditions (energy ≤ 0, age ≥ max_lifespan, or age-only for drift)
- Position update (may use `update_position()` or custom `_drift_update_position()`)

**What a mode must preserve:**
- Shared infrastructure: spatial bucket, zone manager, cosmic rays, aging
- Event queues: `death_events`, `birth_events`, `active_attacks`, `cosmic_ray_events`
- Creature fields: all modes use same Creature/Genome dataclasses
- Toroidal world wrapping

**Boids flock detection algorithm:**
1. Pre-compute neighbor list per creature using spatial bucket (O(n × local_density))
2. BFS connected-components: two creatures connected if either's `sense_radius*1.5` covers the other
3. Singletons (flock size = 1) assigned `flock_id = -1`
4. Performance: O(n × avg_neighborhood) ≈ O(3000) at pop=300, well within 60fps budget
5. Phase sync: `_update_boids_glyph_phases()` lerps each creature's `_glyph_phase` toward
   circular flock average by factor 0.05 per frame

## Visual Theme Contract

A new theme must:

1. Inherit from `Theme` ABC
2. Implement all abstract methods including `render_creature(surface, creature, time, scale=1.0)`
3. Register in `get_theme()`
4. Add to `Settings.VALID_VISUAL_THEMES`

## Known Stubs

**Visual themes (not implemented):**
- `petri`, `geometric`, `chaotic`

All four simulation modes (`energy`, `predator_prey`, `boids`, `drift`) are now fully implemented.

## Performance Notes

### Measured Baselines (2026-03-05)

Headless benchmark harness (`SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy`, 1920×1080):

- **Energy mode step time (before → after audit pass):**
  - pop 50: `1.284ms → 0.803ms`
  - pop 150: `4.082ms → 2.005ms`
  - pop 250: `7.684ms → 3.310ms`
- **Full frame time @ pop 150 (step + render):**
  - `25.445ms → 13.425ms`
- **Boids step time (before → after):**
  - pop 80: `17.135ms → 12.535ms`
  - pop 150: `16.829ms → 11.887ms`
  - pop 250: `16.638ms → 12.803ms`

### Hot-path Approaches Used

- **Boids neighbor reuse:** `_build_boid_neighbor_cache()` computes neighbors once per frame; both force computation and flock BFS reuse it.
- **Distance math reductions:** frequent sqrt distance checks were replaced by toroidal squared-distance comparisons (`_distance_sq`), only taking sqrt when normalization is needed.
- **Toroidal cohesion fix:** boids cohesion now averages wrapped offset vectors rather than absolute coordinates, avoiding edge-wrap centroid artifacts.
- **Render allocation cleanup:** cached age-overlay surfaces, cached cosmic-ray frame surfaces, cached parent-pulse color/frame surfaces, and cached settings shade surface.
- **Resize safety:** `Simulation.resize()` + `Renderer.resize()` prevent stale grids/surfaces after fullscreen/window changes.

### Memory Stability Check

10-minute-equivalent headless run (36,000 frames, energy mode, pop=180):

- RSS `44.76 MB → 45.27 MB` (`+0.51 MB`).
- No unbounded growth observed in simulation-owned structures during continuous stepping.

## Do Not Break

1. **Sim/render decoupling** — `Simulation.step()` must never call pygame or modify visual state
2. **No global mutable state** — all state lives in `Simulation`, `Renderer`, or `Settings`
3. **Settings-driven behavior** — no hardcoded numbers; use `Settings` fields
4. **Toroidal world** — creatures and distance calculations must handle wrapping
5. **Genome immutability** — `Genome` is frozen; mutation returns a new instance
6. **Food spatial bucketing** — maintain bucket structure when modifying `FoodManager`
7. **Trail length cap** — always limit creature trails to `get_trail_length()` positions (not hardcoded 8)
8. **Energy bounds** — creature energy stays in [0.0, 1.0]
9. **Glyph determinism** — same genome must always produce same glyph (hash-seeded RNG)
10. **Event queue ownership** — `death_events` and `birth_events` are populated by simulation, cleared by renderer after processing

## Asset Path Resolution

All asset loading **must** use `get_base_path()` from `primordial/utils/paths.py`:

```python
from primordial.utils.paths import get_base_path

icon_path = get_base_path() / "assets" / "icon.ico"
font_path  = get_base_path() / "primordial" / "assets" / "font.ttf"
```

### Why this matters

When PyInstaller freezes the app with `--onefile`, all files are extracted at
runtime to a temporary directory and `sys._MEIPASS` is set to that directory.
Paths relative to `__file__` or the working directory won't resolve correctly
inside the bundle.

`get_base_path()` abstracts this:

| Environment | Returns |
|-------------|---------|
| Dev (source) | Project root (`Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent`) |
| PyInstaller frozen | `Path(sys._MEIPASS)` |

**Never** use bare `open("assets/foo.png")` or `Path(__file__).parent / "x"` for
files that must ship in the binary — use `get_base_path()` instead.

## Screensaver Argument Parsing

`primordial/utils/screensaver.py` provides `parse_screensaver_args() -> ScreensaverArgs`.

Windows passes arguments to `.scr` files when it invokes them:

| Windows argument | Parsed mode | Behaviour |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| *(none)* | `normal` | Dev / direct launch — full controls, existing behaviour |
| `/s` or `-s` | `screensaver` | Fullscreen, hidden cursor, quit on any user input |
| `/p HWND` or `-p HWND` | `preview` | Render into existing window handle (screensaver Settings preview pane) |
| `/c` or `/c:HWND` | `config` | Show the config/about dialog |

### Preview mode and SDL_WINDOWID

When Windows invokes the `.scr` with `/p HWND`, it expects the screensaver to
render its output into an existing child window identified by the integer HWND.
SDL2 (and therefore pygame) honours the `SDL_WINDOWID` environment variable:
if set before `pygame.init()`, SDL renders into that window instead of creating
a new one.

**Critical ordering:**
1. Root `main.py` calls `parse_screensaver_args()` before importing `primordial.main`
2. If mode is `preview`, it sets `os.environ["SDL_WINDOWID"]` immediately
3. Only then does it `from primordial.main import main` — which triggers the
   module-level `import pygame`
4. `pygame.init()` called inside `main()` therefore sees the env var

Never move the SDL_WINDOWID assignment after the `from primordial.main import main`
line, or preview rendering will silently create a new window instead.

### Screensaver input handling (mode == "screensaver")

The screensaver must exit immediately on real user activity:

- `KEYDOWN` → quit
- `MOUSEBUTTONDOWN` → quit
- `MOUSEMOTION` with `abs(dx) > 4 or abs(dy) > 4` → quit (small threshold
  absorbs jitter; avoids false-quit on initial cursor settling)

A **2-second grace period** (`grace_until = time.time() + 2.0`) suppresses all
input events at startup — some systems emit a spurious mouse-move event when
the screensaver is first activated.

### Dual build output

`build.py` produces both files on Windows after a successful PyInstaller build:

```
dist/primordial.exe   ← for direct double-click launch
dist/primordial.scr   ← identical copy; right-click → Install for screensaver
```

Both files are the same binary; `.scr` is just the extension Windows recognises
as a screensaver. No `--add-data` or other flags differ between the two.

## Runtime CLI Flags

`primordial/utils/cli.py` provides `RuntimeArgs` via `parse_runtime_args()`.

Supported flags:

- `--debug`
  - Enables console logging (file logging is always on)
  - Enables debug HUD timing lines
  - Enables FPS + population history graph overlay
- `--profile`
  - Runs the app for 60 seconds
  - Dumps cProfile binary + text report to the config directory
  - Exits automatically
- `--mode <energy|predator_prey|boids|drift>`
  - Non-persistent mode override for this launch only
- `--theme <ocean|petri|geometric|chaotic>`
  - Non-persistent theme override for this launch only

The parser is tolerant (`parse_known_args`) so Windows screensaver args (`/s`, `/p`, `/c`) continue to work.

### Logging

`primordial/main.py` configures stdlib logging on startup:

- Log file: `primordial.log` in the same platform config directory as `config.toml`
- If that path is not writable, output falls back to the current working directory
- `--debug` adds a stdout handler at `DEBUG` level
- Non-debug runs log at `INFO` to file only

## Build Process

### Entry points

- `main.py` (project root) — top-level entry point; delegates to `primordial.main.main(scr_args, runtime_args)`.
  Used by PyInstaller and can also be run directly with `python main.py`.
- `primordial/main.py` — real implementation; uses relative imports, so it cannot be
  the direct PyInstaller target.

### Building the executable

```bash
python build.py          # cleans dist/, runs PyInstaller, prints result path
pyinstaller primordial.spec  # reproducible rebuild using committed .spec file
```

`build.py` does the following:
1. Deletes `build/` and `dist/` to ensure a clean state
2. Invokes `PyInstaller.__main__.run()` programmatically with `--onefile --noconsole`
3. Attaches `--add-data=primordial/assets:primordial/assets` when that directory exists
4. Attaches `--icon=assets/icon.ico` on Windows when the file exists

### .spec file

`primordial.spec` is committed and should be updated whenever build arguments change
(new `--add-data` entries, new hidden imports, etc.). The spec is regenerated
automatically on each `python build.py` run.

### Adding new assets

1. Place the file under `primordial/assets/` (create the directory if needed)
2. Load it via `get_base_path() / "primordial" / "assets" / "filename"`
3. Add `--add-data=primordial/assets{os.pathsep}primordial/assets` to `build.py` args
   (already present if the directory exists)

## Ollama Integration Note

A future enhancement will add LLM narration. `get_dominant_traits()` now returns all 13 genome traits including the new glyph and motion traits.


## Config file and settings overlay

- Canonical user-meaningful defaults live in committed `primordial/config/defaults.toml`.
- `Config` loads/saves the platform user `config.toml` under the user profile path:
  - Windows: `~/AppData/Roaming/Primordial/config.toml`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Primordial/config.toml`
  - Linux: `~/.config/primordial/config.toml`
- Load order is canonical defaults first, then the user `config.toml` as overrides.
- On first run, a user `config.toml` populated from canonical defaults is written automatically.
- If parse fails, config is backed up to `config.toml.bak` and defaults are restored.
- Unknown config keys are ignored with warning logs (not fatal).
- Type mismatches are coerced safely; invalid values fall back to defaults and are clamped on save.
- In normal mode, `S` opens an in-app renderer-owned settings overlay.
- Overlay behavior: Arrow keys navigate/adjust, Enter applies+saves, Esc/S discards, R twice resets defaults.
- Settings that require reset are marked in the overlay; simulation reset is only triggered by explicit `R`.

When adding a new setting, update all of:
1. Canonical defaults file (`primordial/config/defaults.toml`)
2. Config parsing/validation/serialization (`primordial/config/config.py`)
3. Settings overlay widget list (`primordial/rendering/settings_overlay.py`)
4. AGENT.md settings reference table/notes
5. README.md when user-facing config behavior or locations change

Rule: any newly introduced user-meaningful config or tuning value must be added
to `primordial/config/defaults.toml` in the same change. Do not hide new
user-facing defaults as unexplained Python literals.

Predator/prey reproduction thresholds are mode-scoped config authority:
`[modes.predator_prey].prey_energy_to_reproduce` and
`[modes.predator_prey].predator_energy_to_reproduce` override reproduction
thresholds by species only in `predator_prey`; if absent, resolution falls back
to the shared `energy_to_reproduce`.
These live in TOML mode params today; the in-app overlay still edits only
top-level settings fields unless mode-param support is added explicitly.
